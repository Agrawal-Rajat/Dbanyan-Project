This file contains a series of detailed, sequential prompts for `motif.ai` to generate the UI, page by page.

#### **Prompt 1: The "Brand DNA" Foundation**

**(This is the same detailed prompt as before, as it establishes the core aesthetic which we agreed upon. It will serve as the base for the following page-specific prompts.)**

```
**Prompt for: Dbanyan Group - Brand DNA & UI System**

**Objective:** Generate a foundational UI design system for a premium, natural health brand named "Dbanyan Group." The brand's essence is purity, nature, trust, and calm confidence. The overall aesthetic should feel organic, clean, breathable, and modern.

**1. Color Palette:**
   - **Primary:** Deep Forest Green (`#2C5F2D`). Used for primary buttons, active links, and key headings.
   - **Secondary/Background:** Pale Sage Green (`#97BC62FF`). A soft, muted green for card backgrounds, section backgrounds, and subtle highlights.
   - **Accent:** Vibrant Amber (`#FFBF00`). Used exclusively for critical calls-to-action like "Add to Cart" and "Checkout Now" to create a powerful visual pop.
   - **Neutral Palette:**
     - Off-White (`#F5F5F5`) for main page backgrounds.
     - Light Gray (`#E0E0E0`) for borders, dividers, and disabled states.
     - Dark Charcoal (`#333333`) for all body text for high readability.

**2. Typography:**
   - **Headings (H1, H2, H3):** A modern, elegant serif font like "Lora" or "Merriweather". It should feel authoritative but gentle.
   - **Body Text & UI Elements:** A clean, highly-readable sans-serif font like "Inter" or "Poppins". Prioritize clarity and spacing.

**3. Core Components Style:**
   - **Buttons:**
     - **Primary:** Solid fill with the Primary Green. Subtle shadow on hover. Corners should be slightly rounded (4-6px radius) to feel friendly but structured.
     - **Secondary:** Outlined with the Primary Green color, transparent background. Fills with color on hover.
     - **Accent (CTA):** Solid fill with the Vibrant Amber color. Should have a slight "grow" transform on hover to draw attention.
   - **Cards (Product Cards, etc.):**
     - Use the Pale Sage Green or Off-White for the background.
     - A very subtle, soft drop shadow to make them feel like they are gently floating above the background.
     - Generous internal padding. Content should never touch the edges.
     - Corner radius should match the buttons (4-6px).
   - **Form Inputs (Text fields, dropdowns):**
     - Minimalist design. A simple bottom border or a very light gray filled background.
     - On focus, the border should illuminate with the Primary Green color.
     - Labels should be placed outside the input field for clarity.

**4. Overall Mood & Spacing:**
   - **SPACIOUS & BREATHABLE.** Use significant white space (or rather, "off-white space") between sections and elements. The UI should not feel cramped. It should feel calm and easy to navigate.
   - **Organic, Not Geometric:** Avoid sharp, 90-degree corners. The slight rounding on elements provides a more natural, tactile feel.
   - **Trustworthy:** Visual hierarchy must be clear. The user should always know what is most important on the page. Use font weights and colors to guide their eye naturally.
```
